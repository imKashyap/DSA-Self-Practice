## Arrays

|Sl. No.|Problems Solved| Description|
|-------|---------------|--|
|01|[Matrix Multiplication](./MatrixMultiplication.java)|This Matrix Multipication offers user to input two matrices of nxn size and calculates the multiplication of these matrices.|
|02|[Sieve of Eratosthenes](.SieveOfEratosthenes.java)|Sieve of Eratosthenes is a boolean array whose elements are true if it's index is a prime no.|
|03|[Bubble Sort](./BubbleSort.java.java)|It is the simplest sort method which performs sorting by repeatedly moving the largest element to the highest index of the array. It comprises of comparing each element to its adjacent element and replace them accordingly.|
|04|[Selection Sort](./SelectionSort.java.java)|Selection sort finds the smallest element in the array and place it on the first place on the list, then it finds the second smallest element in the array and place it on the second place. This process continues until all the elements are moved to their correct ordering. It carries running time O(n2) which is worst than insertion sort.|
|05|[Insertion Sort](./InsertionSort.java)|As the name suggests, insertion sort inserts each element of the array to its proper place. It is a very simple sort method which is used to arrange the deck of cards while playing bridge.|
|06|[Merge Sort](./MergeSort.java)|Merge sort follows divide and conquer approach in which, the list is first divided into the sets of equal elements and then each half of the list is sorted by using merge sort. The sorted list is combined again to form an elementary sorted array.|
|06|[Three Sum Equals K](./ThreeSumEqualsK.java)|Print all triplets whose sum is equal to K given as input|
